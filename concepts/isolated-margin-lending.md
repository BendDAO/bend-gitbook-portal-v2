# Isolated Margin Lending

Isolated Margin means the protocol will calculate the heath factor based on single collateral (NFT item) and this mode is same with V1 protocol.

In this model, the liquidation of collateral will be achieved through an auction mechanism.

When should this mode be used? Users believe that their NFT items have some special value, such as used it for PFP.
