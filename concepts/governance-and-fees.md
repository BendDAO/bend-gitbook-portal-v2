# Governance & Fees

## Governance

The role of governance in V2 is purposely minimized to prioritize a trustless experience. BendDAO governance need voting for the operation of a pool or modify its LTV, IRM, or other parameters.&#x20;

## Fees

V2 has a fee switch built into the protocol. Governance can enable a fee ranging from 0% to 30% of the total interest amount paid by borrowers for a given lending pool asset.
