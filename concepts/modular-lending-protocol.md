# Modular Lending Protocol

The V2 protocol introduces modular lending markets, supporting a wide range of assets, use cases, and risk profiles. Four key components form the basis of this modular structure:

* Loan Asset
* Collateral
* Loan-to-Value (LTV)
* Interest Rate Model

BendDAO V2's Modular Lending starts with customized lending pools and extends to yield markets, enabling users to optimize yields by seamlessly allocating funds across different custom pools.

### Customized Lending Pool

Flexibility and Scalability: Users can combine different modules to meet diverse lending requirements, creating pools tailored to specific needs.

### Isolated Risk Control

BendDAO V2's modular architecture isolates risks within individual components, ensuring that issues in one module do not impact the broader protocol.

This flexible architecture supports a wide range of investment strategies, offering a more efficient and personalized lending experience that maximizes capital utilization while aligning with individual risk profiles.
