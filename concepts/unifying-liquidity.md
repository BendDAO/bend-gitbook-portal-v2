# Unifying Liquidity

The Unifying Liquidity serves as the foundation of whole V2 protocol upon which various protocols can be built. It acts as a hub that consolidates liquidity across protocols, eliminating the need for each protocol to independently attract liquidity.

By serving as the hub for liquidity aggregation and management, Unifying Liquidity minimizes capital fragmentation and maximizes the potential for liquidity utilization across protocols, ultimately driving greater value for users.
