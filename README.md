V2 Protocol has three user sides to it:

* Lenders deposit assets to earn passive yield.
* Borrowers can use ERC20 & NFT as collaterals to borrow assets in an overcollateralized fashion.
* Leverage users can use NFT as collaterals to borrow assets to create leverage positions, which can be used across DeFi, NFTs, RWA, etc.
